         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>'TIs not unknown to the meaneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity (I preſume) that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery has ever been a Faction of a very hot and fiery Constitution: And ſince this later Age has produc'd ſo many of theſe Hot-ſpurs and Pulpit-Firebrands, I did imagine 'twere no abuſe in me to divulge what our moſt refined Intellects have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore penned: for I do utterly diſown the Piece, as the iſſue of my own Brain; and am bound to confeſs, that it is but a Collection of what has been penned by the beſt of our Modern Age; onely huddled into the Mould of a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; not out of any contradictory temper of my own, or a vindicative ſpirit, but to ſatisfie the world, that what heretofore hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted or mentioned of them, they were reſolved
<pb facs="tcp:46508:3"/>to manifeſt as an infallible truth; and prove that an Oracle, which was delivered onely as an Opinion. But 'tis inevitable, if we may give credit to what the Satyriſt boldly and truely affirms:
<q>
                        <l>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem</l>
                        <l>Teſta diu, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Veſſel muſt of neceſſity reliſh of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that first it contained. Wherefore, ſince the Original of this pretended new Light of Religion was Rebellion, I am altogether ignorant of any Plea they have to a <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> ſince to make GOD the Author of ſo horrid a Crime, were abſolute Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou art of an opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is here written; I confeſs, that for a time my mind was wandring too, till ſome Cauſes made me to reflect with an impartial Eye upon our preſent Government: Hereupon I took view of their Reaſons and Judgements who I knew to be learned: and ſuppoſing they who wrote before theſe times were moſt likely to ſpeak truth, as being unintereſted in our affairs, from<pb facs="tcp:46508:3"/>them I drew my Collections: then putting them in order, and comparing all together, they ſoon made a conqueſt over me and my opinion.</p>
                  <p>I know the high Talkers, the lighter and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious part of people, will ſhoot many a bitter Arrow to wound my reputation, and charge me with levity and inconſtancy, becauſe I am not obſtinate like themſelves, againſt Conſcience, right Reaſon, Neceſſity, the cuſtom of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the peace of our own. But this ſort of men, I reckon <hi>inter Bruta animantia;</hi> among whom to do well, is to hear ill; who uſually ſpeak amiſs of thoſe things that they do not, or will not, underſtand.</p>
                  <p>But prithee read, and then do what thou liſt. I have onely one word more, and that is to our Modern Phariſee, the Conſcientious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: If he will not be convinced by clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but raiſe more duſt about our Ears to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the people, it muſt be concluded, that all this noiſe of Church-Reformation, Conſcience, and Covenant, is a meer malitious Deſigne to drive on a Faction, and ſet up themſelves in the ſeat of Authority.</p>
                  <p>Being convinced of the truth of theſe things, I conceive my ſelf obliged to ſatisfie others; and<pb facs="tcp:46508:4"/>therefore whatever I have been heretofore, I ſhall liſt my ſelf henceforth,—</p>

                  <head>THE CHARACTER OF A Rigid Presbyter. WITH A Diſcovery of thoſe dangerous Deſignes of the Engliſh and Scotiſh Covenanters, as they have tended to the ruine of our Church and State.</head>
                  <p>TO give you an exact Character of him, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; he is as changeable as a <hi>Proteus:</hi> yet if you pleaſe to have his Genealogie <hi>ab origine,</hi> which may be ſaid to reſemble a Welch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree, take it as it was left by one of the beſt Pens of this Modern Age.</p>
                  <p>Never was there ſuch a monſtrous Babe, as this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46508:5"/>&amp; domineering Presbytery; the Father of it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the Mother Inſurrection, the Midwife Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the Nurſe Coverouſneſs, the Milk Schiſm, the Coats Armour, the Rattles Drums, a bloody Sword the Coral, Money the Babie it delights to play with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: it grows up to be a ſtripling, and goes to School to a Council of War; its Leſſon is on the Trumpet, its Feſcue a Piſtol, its play-days the days of Battel, and black-Monday the Day of Judgement: it comes of age, and is married with a
<hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> it begets Children like it ſelf, whoſe bleſſing upon them, is the power of the Sword; and whoſe impoſition of Hands, are broken Pates. This Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cries down the antient Catholick and Apoſtolick power which the Biſhops had, and then takes it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and exerciſes it in a higher nature then ever Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did; even to the depoſition of Kings, and the delivering them up to the Executioner.</p>
                  <p>Should we trace this viperous Brood from their firſt riſe and original, we ſhall finde their Deſignes founded on Rebellion, to the ruine and deſtruction of the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> under whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions the Faction firſt pullulated. 'Twould be too prolix, and inconſiſtent with a Character, to tell you how they have dealt likewiſe with our Princes here at home, verifying that Maxime,
<q>NO BISHOP, NO KING.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But take a ſhort Epitomy of their Actions in what followeth: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> with his Gladiators having expuls'd the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> erects a Government<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46508:5"/>ſo loſty and unexpected, that the People would have nothing to do, either with him or it; and thereupon baniſhed him: being in exile, he plots and contrives the pacification of the peoples fury, by inventing his new fangle of Lay-Elders, which made them ſharers in the Government, and endeared the people to him, ſo that all parties were agreed.</p>
                  <p>As for our Princes here at home,</p>
                  <p>Do but obſerve the behaviour of <hi>Knox</hi> and
<hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> and the reſt of that Gang, to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, as it is related by King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, in his Diſcourſe at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> to the Presbytery. Theſe two pre-mentioned,
<hi>viz. Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> came to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, telling her, That by right no Pope nor Potentate whatſoever had any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over her, in her own Dominions, either in caſes Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, but that ſhe was Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in both, and conſtituted by GOD, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nurſing Mother of his Church within her own Kingdom; and therefore conjured her to have a care of the <hi>Evangel</hi> of Chriſt, as ſhe would anſwer it at the dreadful Day of Judgement: She firſt gives them her Ear, and at laſt her Authority; they make uſe of it in the firſt place to the pulling down of Biſhops, and exalted themſelves in their places; and when the Queen expected an abſolute Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, behold, all that this Rabble would allow her, was not ſo much as to have one private Chappel for her ſelf, nor one Prieſt to ſerve GOD according to her own Conſcience. She finding her hopes fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and her ſelf ſo much deluded, endeavours to recal her Authority; ſhe takes up Arms, they oppoſe her, combat her, beat her out of her Kingdom; ſhe flees<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46508:6"/>into
<hi>England</hi> for refuge; they follow her with Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, thruſt jealouſie into the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Boſome concerning her; whereupon ſhe was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and after a long and tedious impriſonment, put to death. Thus King <hi>James</hi> having put a period to his Diſcourſe directed to Dr. <hi>Reynolds, Knewſtubs,</hi> and the reſt, turns to the Biſhops, and cloſes his Oration with this Animadverſion: <hi>Wherefore, my Lords, I thank you for my Supremacie: for if it were at theſe mens diſpoſals, I am very ſenſible what would become of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you deſire to be ſatisfi'd concerning their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with King <hi>James,</hi> her Son, Father to the Martyr <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed memory, you may finde it in his <hi>Baſilicon Doron: Crebrae adverſus me in Tribunitiis Conſcionibus Calumniae ſpargebantur; non quod ordinem aliquod deſignaſſem, ſed quia Rex eram, quod om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni crimine pejus habebatur.</hi> Are theſe men fit to make good Subjects? Did they not convene him, and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize him like a School-boy? Did he not proteſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſon <hi>Henry,</hi> that he hated their proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carriage, ever ſince he was ten years of age? Did he not ſay, That Monarchy and Presbytery agreed like GOD and the Devil? And have not we found it ſo, if we conſider the carriage of our new-fangled Presbyterians in
<hi>England,</hi> to <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, his Son? But alas! I am miſtaken, they faſted and pray'd, preached and writ againſt it, praying for a diverſion of all ſuch black intentions: and yet the Presbyterian took the Scepter out of his hand, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Militia, of which it was an Emblem; caſt down his Throne, by depriving him of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Voice; took his Crown, the Fountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, off his head, by denying thoſe Honour, on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46508:6"/>whom he had worthily conferred it, without them; took away his Supremacy, ſignifi'd by the ſacred Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherewith he was anointed, in denying him the Liberty of his Conſcience, in the point of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie and Church-government: nor would they treat a minute with their King, till they had made him acknowledge himſelf guilty (as they ſay) of all the blood that had been ſpilt throughout his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: and notwithſtanding all the Conceſſions on his part, that could poſſibly be granted, even to the very grating of his Princely Conſcience; when he bid them ask fleſh from his bones, and he would not deny it, if it might in any meaſure redound to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his people, praying that he might keep his Conſcience whole, (the Queen Regent of all good mens actions, and he hoped there were none would force this Queen before him in his houſe, as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Haman</hi>) yet not withſtanding all this, was it voted unſatisfactory ſo long, till the Independent Army came from <hi>Edinborougb,</hi> ſurprized and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He that ſaid, The Presbyterian held him down by the Hair, while the Independents cut off his Head, ſaid true enough. They murdered him as a King, before ever they murdered him as a Man: And when time ſerves, the Philoſopher's Maxime will paſs for good and currant Logique at Court, <hi>Qui vult media adfinem, vult etiam &amp; ipſum finem;</hi> He that wills the means conducing to the end, wills alſo the end it ſelf:
<hi>Ergo</hi> (will the Royaliſts ſay) ſince the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian put ſuch courſes in practiſe, as tended to the King's ruine, they certainly intended it, and are as deeply guilty as others. Nay, may not the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſay, You took off his Authority, and we took<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46508:7"/>off his Head; you made him no King, and we made him no Body; you made him a Man of Blood, and we treated him accordingly. Therefore at your doors, O ye Presbyterian Hypocrites, his innocent Blood is lay'd: nor is it any other then your Actions have been all along; and thoſe committed by your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors to former Princes and Kings. But ſure there is ſome Excuſe remaining; they fought for Religion. I wonder when the Church did change her Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: Muſt Prayers and Tears be turn'd into Pike and Muſquet? Did GOD refuſe to have his Temple built by
<hi>David,</hi> a Man after his own Heart, becauſe onely his hands were bloody? And will he now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to have his Church repair'd, and her Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made up with Skulls and Carcaſſes? Muſt Blood be tempered with the Mortar that muſt binde the Stones of his Temple in Unity? Or are the ſmitings of Brethrens ſtrokes fit to poliſh her Stones withal? Hath GOD refuſed the ſoft voice, to remain in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Or hath his Spirit left the gentle poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending down upon his Apoſtles, to the approaching of a mighty and ruſhing winde? To go about the reforming of a Church by humane ſtrength, is quite as oppoſite to the nature of Reformation, as is the going about the repairing of a Caſtle-Wall with a Needle and Thred. He that looks to finde ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable goodneſs within Iron-ſides, may as well expect to finde a Pearl in a Lobſter. No, no, the Church muſt not be defended with Helmets, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſters of blows; but with Miters, which have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the cleft already; not by broken Pates, but by clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Tongues; not by Men clad in Buff, but by Prieſts cloathed with Righteouſneſs. Deciſions in matters<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46508:7"/>of Faith, muſt not be determined by Armour of proof; nor did the Sword of the Spirit ever make way to the Conſcience by cutting through the Fleſh. He therefore who takes up Arms againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign with pretences of defending his Religion, doth but take ſuch courſes as are condemned by the ſame Religion he would defend: and indeed, he doth but make Religion his ſtalking-Horſe, to blinde him, whilſt he aims at that which he would have leaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him; which when he hath effected, he means to get up upon the Horſe, and ride him at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: they pretend the good of the Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing more but the Goods thereof; and like diſſembling Lapwings, make a ſhew of being neareſt the Neſt, when they are fartheſt off it.</p>
                  <p>But they fought for Liberty: Theſe are <hi>piaefraudes, &amp; Religioſi doli;</hi> pious Frauds, religious Deceits: for pray what Liberties did they fight for? If for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, What do you mean thereby? If by Liberty of Conſcience, you mean, That it ſhall be lawful for every one to make a free choice of his own Religion, or to be of his own Opinion, theſe are things which we ought not to have, much leſs to fight for; for then let us not blame every <hi>Painim,</hi> that bakes his cake to the queen of heaven, or every ignorant Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who creeps to his own Image, or makes his own Idol: for in this kind of liberty we do but ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the net wherein we ſee our ſelves caught, and burn incenſe to the drag that hales us to deſtruction. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not to be at ſuch Liberty: looſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are but loſt men: true Chriſtians will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be bound up in the Unity of the ſame Spirit, and with the bond of Peace: if the bond be broken,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46508:8"/>the Sheaf of Corn is but ſo many looſe Ears, and no way fit to be carried into the Lords Barn: if we be Sons and Daughters, let us belong all to one Houſe; if we be Servants, let us be all of one Family; if we be lively Stones, let us be all of one Building; if we be ſeveral Grapes, yet let us be all of one Cluſter; if we be ſeveral Cluſters, let us be all of one Vine; if we be Saints, let us have a Communion: for this is it which is called the Communion of Saints; this is it which is called Religion, which is derived <hi>à Religan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> which ſignifies, to binde. Wherefore for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan not to think himſelf bound to thoſe Articles the Church propoſes, is to be of no Religion; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o fight for this, is to fight for nothing.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the Presbyter may likewiſe maintain, that he fought for Liberty from Oppreſſion: That is but a weak Excuſe, and carries little of Reaſon or Sence in it: for there is not any Man or Woman, of what Quality or Condition ſoever he be, that underſtands what belongs to any ſuch thing; unleſs it be ſome few that have liberty to do what they will with all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But what if they took up Arms for the property of the Subject? Alas! I preſume the Subjects had then ſo altered the property of their Goods, that had they but the old properties reſtor'd, they would not think it good fighting for a new; their expectations being ſo much deceiv'd, that inſtead of fighting for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, they rather found themſelves ſubject to have all things in common.</p>
                  <p>If for the Laws of the Land; Whoſe Laws were they? Were they not the King's? And was it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he would not maintain the Foundation of<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46508:8"/>his Houſe from ſinking? Would he not maintain his Leggs under him? Were they not Supporters of that Body Politick whereof he was Head? Nay, does he not maintain himſelf, when he maintains them? for the King and his Laws may, without abſurdity, be compared to GOD and his Word, both inſeparable: for as GOD is the Word, and the Word is GOD; ſo the King is the Law, as the Life thereof; and the Law is the King, as the Body of that Soul. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needed not any fighting againſt the King upon this account, except it were by thoſe who were ambitious to be Kings themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As for Priviledges of Parliament, which poſſibly may come into the number of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: I have read of <hi>Jack Cade,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Speed</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle.</hi>
                     </note> in the Reign of
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up as far as <hi>London-Stone,</hi> and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf thereon, vowed, That within three days, there ſhould be no other Law but what did proceed out of his own Mouth. Now if it ſtand with the Priviledges of Parliament, to have a few <hi>Jack Cades,</hi> relying on their <hi>London-</hi>Stones, to tell them what they muſt do, and they will have; if it ſtands with the Priviledges of the Presbyterian Parliament, to have Tumults to drive away their King, Armies to awe themſelves, Countries to ſend up their Inhabitants in Multitudes, with Petitions in their Hats, Cudgels in their Hands, and Threatnings in their Mouths, then they have fought to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But admit the Puritano-Parliament fought for all theſe Particulars, ſo did the King too: ſo that the King might ſafely expoſtulate with his Parliament, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did with the reſt of the Apoſtles: Are ye<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46508:9"/>Fighters for the Proteſtant Religion? ſo am I: Are you for the Liberties of the Subject? ſo am I: Are you for the Laws of the Land? ſo am I: Are you for the Priviledges of the Parliament? ſo am I: <hi>And in all theſe things, I have laboured more abundantly then you all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where lies the Quarrel then? It muſt of neceſſity conſiſt in nothing but this, That they did not believe one another: and in that they both fought for one and the ſame Thing, the means of Reconciliation is taken away: for, had they differ'd in their Grounds, the Law might have been Judge between them; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be Judge, the World might be Judge; but
<hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> inſtead of having reaſon to fight, they did but fight againſt Reaſon: both contended for the ſame Power, like the two Women that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the ſame Child: <hi>Solomon</hi> judged the Child to belong to her who would rather part with it all, then have the Child divided: Now the Parliament would have this powerful Child divided, half to the King, and half to themſelves; the King rather was contented to loſe all. In whom there is moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pity, in him is the Right of true Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there were no <hi>Solomons</hi> in that Age, we will go the downright way to work.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyter fought in defence of the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Crown and Dignity; can you believe him? I'm ſure you may believe and be confident the King did. They took up Arms to unite him to his Parliament, and make him a moſt glorious Monarch, by reviling his ſacred Perſon, and beſpattering him with malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tongues; did they not then fight upon falſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46508:9"/>Grounds? Did they not give themſelves the lye? and ſhall they be believed ſtill? But inſtead of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by
<hi>Solomons</hi> divided Child, they divided their <hi>Solomon.</hi> But if they had remembred what ill luck the Nation ever had by impriſoning their Kings one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they would have deſiſted ſpeedily from their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Enterprize: for when they had impriſoned the old Lion and the young, within their Grates, the third <hi>Henry</hi> and his Son, did they not make the whole Land ſhake? Had not the whole Kingdom a ſhrewd Ague-fit at that very time? Did they not (like fire too cloſe beſieg'd with Clouds) ſally out in Thunder and Lightning, to the terrour and deſtruction of all thoſe that ſtood in the way? What ſucceſs had the impriſonment of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second? Upon his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment followed his Depoſition, and the murder of his Perſon was the conſequent of the depoſement of his Dignity. But what became of thoſe that were the occaſion of it, and did it? Is there one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Name of <hi>Mortimer?</hi> Was not that <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> who was the cauſe of his impriſonment, behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Were not all thoſe who had a hand in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignly puniſhed? Nay, was not the immediate Heir of this too much Conniver at his Fathers Sufferings, and too ready Accepter of his Fathers Office, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, depoſed and murdered? And pray ſatisfie me in this likewiſe, What ſucceſs had the impriſonment of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second? It coſt the Kingdom whole Ages of miſeries, 80 of her Nobility, and 100000 of her Commons, &amp; the diſpoſing of all her Royal Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in their Buds, before they were half blown, until there was but one of a colour left in the Royal Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and they being married, made<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46508:10"/>a compoſure of Red and White, as bluſhing at the former Miſchiefs.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyter is a Zealous Dragooner, the Holy Man of War, that is ever beating up his Drums a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Loyalty and Nobility: ſearch through the New Teſtament, and you may learn the Genealogie of our Saviour, by the Names in their Regiments; nor need the Muſter-Maſter uſe any other Liſt then the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> which makes me admire how they could ever object to the King, the bringing in of Forraigners, when they themſelves maintain'd ſuch an Army of Hebrews. He is one that rifles Colledges, to promote Learning; and pulls down Churches, for Edification. He had once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt put out one of the Kingdoms Eyes, by cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Univerſities; and if that Scotch miſt had farther prevail'd, had extinguiſh'd the other. 'Twas never a good world, ſince the name of Church was turn'd into Kirk, and afterwards dwindled into a Conventicle; 'twas a ſad time ever ſince a feeble <hi>By my truly</hi> did walk the Streets as familiarly among us, as <hi>Myn Heer</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> But now we have his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty reſtored to his right Title, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of a better World, <hi>Velit nolit Smectymnuus,</hi> in ſpite of the Presbyters Teeth.</p>
                  <p>He is one that hath as little minde to do the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom good, as the Church hath to lap holy-Water. He is a Pulpit <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> that uſes to give the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation a Scotiſh Jigg, and ſo tune his Noſe with Hymns and Songs for the deſtruction of the Nobility of our Engliſh Nation; a Butcher that exercis'd his Function, <hi>Cum Privilegio,</hi> in former times, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring Loyalty to the Shambles: one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46508:10"/>was quiet, till the Creatures of the Prerogative were all turn'd into the Pound together; till the Peers were pickled up with their King, to ſatisfie his ambitions on his Prince, and to feed on the Carcaſſes of the People. He is one that thinks it is his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and would quote Scripture ſor't, <hi>To binde the Kings and Nobles of the earth in chains:</hi> and yet to dreſs out all for his more devout palate, the name of GOD muſt be placed in the front of his ſucceſs, as if he were the onely Darling of the Almighty, or rather, as if he were Preſident in all the Proceedings and Conſultations of the Presbyterian Iſrael. His God is his Money, and therefore will rather make Money of GOD and the Church, then fail of an Inheritance. He did endeavour ſome few years paſt, to convert our Times into the Primitive; and made Great <hi>CHARLES</hi> wear Fig-leave Breeches, like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> by ſtripping him of his Royal Robes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
                  <p>As for the Scotiſh Presbyter, I am ſorry I muſt waſte Paper upon him: But being he hath ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured tooth and nail, according to his utmoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to make himſelf conſiderable by being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, it will not be amiſs to ſound the depth of their conſtant Deſignes: which that I may the better do, give me leave to trace them in their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from the firſt to the laſt, upon our Engliſh Nation.</p>
                  <p>When they firſt found themſelves powerful in their own Country, they became moſt zealous in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Presbyterian Diſcipline againſt the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal; by which means they gained the Amity and Friendſhip of all the pretended Religious Party in<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46508:11"/>
                     <hi>England:</hi> for they ſtood ſeemingly for no ſiniſter ends, but meerly for the purity of Religion, and Liberty of Conſcience, againſt Epiſcopal Power and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they termed the moſt ancient Doctrine of the Church; as alſo, for the Laws and Liberties of the Nation, invaded by the Prerogative: for the redreſs of which Abuſes, a Parliament was call'd; who not obtaining ſuch a relief of forged Grievances, as they expected; pretended a conſtraint of taking up Arms in defence of their Liberties; and the Engliſh Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots had recourſe to the Scots for their aſſiſtance, who immediately condeſcended thereunto, and thought it but Reaſon and Equity to joyn with them, without diſpute or ſcruple, (pretty tender-conſcienc'd Babes they were, in the interim! that's clear:) But they conſidering now was the time (if ever) to make their Markets, and their own Intereſt as much Engliſh as might be, came not off ſo roundly as they expected; wherefore they fell to bartering, like Huckſters, and no Bargain could be made, forſooth, without a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: They would not joyn, except they might be (in a manner) all one with us; and this Union muſt be ſeal'd with that <hi>Solemn League and Covenant:</hi> What their meaning was therein, you ſhall underſtand by and by, by taking a view of their Actions, which are the moſt ſure Interpreters. <hi>Yet even at that time, ſome men had their eyes in their heads, and many Objections were made at divers Expreſsions in the Covenant, and many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for Explanations of ſome Articles more fully.</hi> But the Scots ſtanding ſtiff upon their own Terms, and no Conjunction like to be obtain'd without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Engliſh Presbyterians neceſſities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring no delay, (as they imagin'd) were glad to<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46508:11"/>take it as it was offer'd, without farther queſtion, or demur.</p>
                  <p>It was no ſooner taken here at <hi>London,</hi> but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately every one began to make his advantages, (through the multitude and ambiguity of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and by it to promote his ſeveral Intereſt; as if it had been made to engage unto a particular Party, not to unite two Nations in a common Intereſt. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the <hi>Scots,</hi> having had the honor of this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conceived themſelves much injur'd by any that deny'd them the Prerogative of making an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and in matter of Religion, urged their own Diſcipline as the only Pattern to reform the Church by; and their Plea had been far better, could they have proved it to be
<hi>[According to the Word of GOD]</hi> which Clauſe was moſt luckily inſerted. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Reaſons to the contrary, the Scotiſh Module was ſtill preſſed: The Scot was willing to ride; and having (as he thought) the Engliſh faſt bridled with a Covenant, he began to ſwitch and ſpur: The Throne of the Kirk was the ſtalking-horſe to catch Geeſe; and if that could have been ſettled, then there had been no denying them whatſoever they could ask; they would have ſeated themſelves finely in this fat ſoil, and ſurely too; there would be no removing them out of our Councils, whereof they had then been Members and Partakers. For had the Kirk-Intereſt been once confirmed among us, then by vertue of that Authority which they uſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole the Civil Power, the Parliament muſt have been ſubſervient to all their Ends and Purpoſes; and ſince the Engliſh Puritans had been (as they ſay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd (to make their Party ſtrong, and maintain<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46508:12"/>Correſpondencies for their own preſervation) to gratifie their Scotiſh Founders in all their Deſires; ſo that the Scots might eaſily have tranſlated the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Union, to as good as an abſolute National-Union, by gaining a Joynt-Intereſt with us, in our Affairs for ever; and conſequently, in all the Profits, great Offices, Councels and Concernments of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now whether this were their Deſign or not, in the Covenant,
<hi>ab origine,</hi> I ſhall not now determine; but let it be judged by their inſolent behaviour here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, after they were admitted to our Councils: And therefore in the next place, I ſhall examine their Proceedings, which moſt evidently repreſent them in their intentions.—It ſufficed them not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were come in, that they had an equal Power with the Factions in the Committee at <hi>Derby-Houſe,</hi> which was allowed them; but driving a powerful Party in both Houſes, they took upon them to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with matters relating to the future peace and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Nation, much pretended, but not at all intended; and that dinſtinct from their own too; and to provide for an equal Intereſt with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt moſt notorious Evidence of this (though there had been many before) was diſcovered at the <hi>Uxbridge-Treaty,</hi> where the Propoſitions of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being preſented to his Majeſty of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was found the Scots had ſo far provided for themſelves by their Party in the Houſes, That in time to come, the ordering of the Engliſh Militia, the power of making War and Peace, and all other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of Government, were to be adminiſtred by<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46508:12"/>a proportionable number of Scots, as well as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: A thing ſo ridiculous, and an Encroachment ſo palpable, that his Majeſty, in one of his Anſwers, took notice of it, and ſaid, <hi>He was not ſo much an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Engliſh Nation, as to ſigne thoſe Propoſitions:</hi> or ſomewhat (I'm confident) to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Evidence or Diſcovery of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, was made upon the delivering in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers papers to the Parliament, at ſeveral times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they diſputed their claim, and ventured their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick upon the Letter of the Covenant, to prove an Intereſt in diſpoſal of matters meerly relating to our welfare (as was thought;) which they re-inforced afterwards, with new recruits of Arguments, when the King came into their Army.</p>
                  <p>But not knowing how to maintain their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were contented for that time to quit them, and the King too, upon ſuch Terms as are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all the world; who being at length reduced under the power of the Parliament and Army, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were ſent to him at
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no ſuch Proviſion being made for the Scotiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as was in thoſe at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> their Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers here proteſted againſt them, accuſed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Breach of Covenant, and complained high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one of their Declarations, that they ſhould be ſo neglected.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve as a third Evidence of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Deſign of Encroachment: Whereto may be added one more: When the King, Father of our moſt gratious Soveraign, was at
<hi>Carisbrook-Caſtle,</hi> whither the Commiſſioners of Parliament were no ſooner arrived with Propoſitions again, but the<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46508:13"/>Scots Commiſſioners were at hand, and for the ſame reaſon, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Having ſmelt out their Project thus far, give me leave to trace them on to the end, as ſuccinctly as may be.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Party being ſuppreſt, and ſo no farther occaſion to make uſe of the Scotiſh Army, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſome difficulty made a ſhift to ſend them home into their own Country; but being defeated of their Aims and Expectations, they could not ſo reſt: Having failed of their Ends by pretending for Parliament, they reſolved next to try what they could do upon the Kings Score; and ſo the Grandees turn'd the Tables, in hope of an after-Game, by cloſing with Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> upon the Royal Account; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but if they gain'd the Day this way, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their Travels with much more advantage. The Covenant, like a
<hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> apt to be turned any way, ſerved this Enterprize every jot as well as the former; though the Deſigne were different from what it was, the Great ones not caring much what became of the Kirk-Intereſt, ſince they had agreed for the ſecurity of their own; which muſt needs have been very conſiderable, if they could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46508:13"/>his Majeſty, and reſtored him into the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an abſolute Monarch. Therefore the Kirk ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves left in the lurch, thundered out their Curſes amain, upon that hypocritical Engagement, as deſtructive to the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But the Grandees being at a loſs likewiſe, upon Duke
<hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Defeat, were glad to cry <hi>Peccavi</hi> to the Kirk.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after, a new Door of Hope being opened to them, by the Right of Succeſſion which they knew belonged to his preſent MAJESTY; they to ingratiate with him, proclaim him their King: and here the Grandees and the Kirk joyning hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, become Friends, and offer their ſervice for his Reſtitution upon Terms of the Covenant, which was pretended to be framed at firſt for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt Regal power; but is, now that the Scots can ſerve their Deſign no longer that way, become the ground of their compliance with his MAJESTY; being reſolved this way, ſince they have failed in all the reſt, to try whether they could accompliſh their profane Projects through the Covenant, by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into places of Honour, Profit and Power, that they may domineer in the Poſſeſſions, as their <hi>Phariſaical Prieſts</hi> would over the Conſciences of the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus having made way, in diſcovering what the Deſign of the Scots hath ever been, and is at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; certainly no Man, that is Maſter of a true Engliſh Spirit, but will abhor the Hypocritical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Encroachments of that perſidious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:46508:14"/>Therefore it being evident that their Deſigne in urging the Covenant upon the Presbyterian here in
<hi>England,</hi> was only to inſinuate themſelves into an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Intereſt with our own Nation; I ſhall in the next place, diſcover the great Inconveniencies and Hazards that our Nation muſt of neceſſity have undergone, in caſe it ſhould happen as they ever endeavour'd, to be knit together in a National Union.</p>
                  <p>A National Union hath been often whiſpered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them heretofore; and there's no doubt but they would bid high for it, if ever they have occaſion; and then it muſt needs have been a very fine world, when we had been confounded with a miſcellany of Scotiſh and Engliſh; when Scots ſhould have been competitors with us in point of priviledge, vie wealth with us in our Poſſeſſions, Honours and Dignities; and they would either have impos'd new Laws upon us, or alter'd the old, according as they judg'd it for their advantage; for a Scotch Covenanters ſtomach will allow no diſtinction betwixt Presbyter and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, but can digeſt the Eſtate of an Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter, without ſo much as a ſcruple of regret or compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>But it is a very great wonder, ſince the ſtage-play of the Covenant, and the Actors are brought on this ſide the Curtain, and we know what they are, through all their Diſguiſes, and what they aim at, that yet many of our Engliſh Nation ſhould be ſo ſtupid as to be led away with their cheats and pretences for a Reformation; ſince it is evident that their chief Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Sticklers gape onely after Profit and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and (according to the cuſtome of all Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Arms) will make no diſtinction between<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46508:14"/>Friend and Foe, ſo they may ſatisfie their covetous and ambitious ends.</p>
                  <p>And for a concluſion to the whole, as to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that theſe particulars may appear more ſolid then meer inſinuation, give me leave to confirm what we have ſaid concerning them, by ſome Authentick Examples; it being an ordinary caſe in the World, That

                  <p>Here before I proceed, let me call to minde a ſtory of the Hedgehog in the Fable, who being almoſt dead with cold, chanced to light upon a Foxes Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; where, asking for entertainment, the Fox more compaſſionate then wiſe, grants his Requeſt: but the Hedghog, as ſoon as he recovered warmth, began to briſtle and prick the Fox; who complaining of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy carriage, the Hedghog made anſwer, <hi>That if he found him troubleſome, he might leave him, and ſeek a new Lodging.</hi> I ſhall leave the Application to thoſe that would entertain the Scots as Friends, to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould finde more courteſie from them, if they had power here, then the Fox did from the Hedghog, or then other Nations have had from the friendly pretences of forraign Auxiliaries.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this, there are ſeveral Preſidents.</p>

                  <p>A quarrel happening between the two <hi>Saracen Sultans</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>

                  <p>On the other ſide, a controverſie ariſing betwixt

<hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, in old time, our Anceſtors, the Saxons, being called in by <hi>Vortigern,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sam. Daniel.</note> the Britiſh King, to aſſiſt him againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of the <hi>Picts</hi> and
<hi>Scots,</hi> turn'd their Arms againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> and driving them into <hi>Wales,</hi> tranſmitted the poſſeſſion of this Iſland, to us their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Scots</hi> likewiſe (as <hi>Bodin</hi> affirms)<note place="margin">John Bodin. li. 5. cap. 5.</note> being called in to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Picts</hi> againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the beſt part of that Kingdom, which they hold at this day.</p>
                  <p>And now I would fain know of the Admirers of the Scotiſh Nation, what aſſurance they can have, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their fiue Flouriſhes of pretended Friendſhip, that they ſhould not ſerve us, as their Anceſtors did the <hi>Picts;</hi> or as others did other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom they oppreſt under as glorious pretences, in caſe they ſhould get the power into their hand; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince of late time they have made ſo many palpable Diſcoveries of Encroachment upon the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46508:16"/>Seeing therefore, that their Covenant-Cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a Cauſe for Intrenchment upon our National Intereſt, rather then for Religion or Monarchy; I may reaſonably conclude, That it concerns all Parties whatſoever (if not for the miſery that would follow it, yet out of a deteſtation of their Deſignes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours) to ſhake them off, and utterly relinquiſh them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Engliſh Presbytery, whence it was, hath been manifeſted already; but for what ends brought into <hi>England,</hi> is not here to be diſputed: But if we ſhould grant the intentions of its firſt Fautors to be pure in the Fountain, (as they would fain maintain, though we are ſatisfi'd to the contrary) yet it appears polluted in the ſtreams, by the corruption of their Succeſſors: for, as the Primitive Pretences of it were high and glorious, in its infancy; ſo being grown up to maturity, it hath (after the manner of all other things that participate of worldly mixtures) in time contracted ſo many Adulterations of worldly Intereſt, that it hath loſt the Beauty which it once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have, and ſerves every Sophiſter, as a Cloak to cover his ambitious Deſignes.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it is arrived, notwithſtanding, to ſuch a height, in the opinion of many, as to be cried up for the onely Pattern of Government under the Goſpel, this is to be imputed to the blinde Zeal of thoſe that are miſled, and the Deceitfulneſs of the Leaders, rather then the intention of its Author, Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as it appears: for he never ſeem'd to ſtretch his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule ſo far, as the Neceſſity and Univerſality of a <hi>DIVINE RIGHT;</hi> but ſeems onely to have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46508:16"/>hewn part of the Building out of the Rock of the Scriptures, and piec'd up the reſidue by politique Rules, ſuch as he conceiv'd might ſound neareſt the Text, and ſerve moſt conveniently to cement the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted Members of the then broken and tumultuous Commonwealth of <hi>Geneva,</hi> into an intire and well-compacted Body.</p>
                  <p>It was no ſooner lick'd into Form there, but (as it is the fate of all things new) it began to be much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd and admir'd; and the fame thereof ſpreading in <hi>England,</hi> as well as other parts, wrought in many of our <hi>Country-men,</hi> an itching deſire to go thither, and inſtruct themſelves in the Nature and Cuſtoms of the Government; where, of Spectators, they ſoon became Proſelytes; and returning home with new affections, look'd with an Eye of Diſdain upon the Biſhops, as if themſelves had indeed found out the Pattern in the Mount, becauſe (forſooth) the words, <hi>Presbytery, Elder, Deacon</hi> and
<hi>Aſſembly,</hi> &amp;c. ſound more Goſpel-like, then <hi>Dioceſs, Church-warden, Arch-deacon,</hi> and <hi>High-Commiſsion,</hi> &amp;c. With theſe Terms the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Maxima pars vulgi capitur Ambagibus.</hi>
                     </note> ordinary ſort of Religious Perſons, not able to ſee through the Shell of words, into the Kernell or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the buſineſs, were eaſily led to a belief of high matters; whereas this new form, like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, brought an Army of Miſchiefs in the belly of it, which have of late years been ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>For immediately after the Epiſcopal Form was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed here, as corrupt and Antichriſtian, the chief Sticklers of the Presbyterian Faction began to ſhew their Teeth; and ſitting in an Aſſembly cheek by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46508:17"/>jole with the Parliament, intermedled with their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, laboured to twiſt their Church-Diſcipline with the intereſt of State; claimed in their open Pleas, Diſcourſes, and their Confeſſion of Faith, a Power in themſelves, diſtinct from the Civil, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voting of this in both Houſes, as <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that ſo by degrees they might creep, till they had got to ſuch a height, that none ſhould be ſole Lords and Maſters, but they and their Confederates.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and many other pranks they play'd, in hope to erect their intended Domination: And though (being often required) they were never able to ſhew their Pedegree from the Apoſtles, or derive the Linca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Form from the Body of the Scripture; yet they preſt it on ſtill, and wanted not their Party in Parliament, with the aſſiſtance of the Scots (whoſe Intereſt it was) to ſecond them. But all is blaſted, and their ſpecious pretences found out to be nothing but Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>Yet were there perpetually, when they found their Cauſe to falter, Presbyterian Juglings in private, Murmurings abroad, and Mutinies in the Pulpit; ſuch well-acted Lamentations for the glory of the Kirk departing, and the loſs of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayer was a Stratagem, and moſt Sermons meer Plots againſt the Government they lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Thus the nature of their Deſigne being diſcovered, give me leave in the next place to manifeſt the vanity of their Hopes, that if men will not forbear for ſhame of its hypocriſie, they may yet, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the many ſad Conſequents which may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46508:17"/>For though they uſe all poſſible means to draw in the Royal Party to their own, yet it can never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: for the Royaliſts look upon them ſtill (and that not without apparent reaſon) as the Authors of their miſery; for they reduc'd our moſt ſacred King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the firſt, <hi>Diminutione Capitis,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Captive; they ſpoil'd him as a King, before others executed him as a private Man; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him of his Earthly Crown, and kept him languiſhing; whereas a reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church ſays,

                  <p>As for the inconveniences which the Presbyterian Deſigne would bring upon the whole Nation, gueſs at them by theſe following Particulars.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the many Miſchiefs it would bring upon the Nation in general, the Royaliſt can no ways be content with it; nor indeed, have they any Reaſon ſort, being abſolutely deſtructive to Regal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

He will be ſure to cry down the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, and ſo be the cauſe, that like wild Beaſts without Bridling, Men wander and range as they pleaſe, with all Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs in Doctrine and Manners, and run over all the Boundaries of Civil Relations or Propriety, to make way for a Pious Parity and Communion, whereby we may all walk together in pure Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without either reſpect of Perſons or Sexes. He has a Motley Face, and a Medley Conſcience; and
'tis a thouſand pities but that his Picture ſhould be<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46508:19"/>taken after the faſhion of thoſe ſquint <hi>Italian</hi> Pieces, which preſent a Saint on one ſide, and a Monſter on the other.</p>
                  <p>He's a divine <hi>Jocky,</hi> that drives as furiouſly as
<hi>Jehu;</hi> and will run out of his ſmall Wits with ſwitch and ſpur, for preferment. He could willingly creep into the Vice-Chancellour's Scarlet, or the Deanery of <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> and if he does at any time, 'tis tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the name of <hi>Maſterſhip;</hi> to ſhew that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended Reformation ſhould reach any farther then to change the prophane names of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deans,</hi> into <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> who may enjoy the old Poſſeſſions under a new Form, without ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified and ſuperſtitions Titles, which are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtumbling-blocks to the converted Gentiles, in the High-way of Sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>He's a vile Cobler of Controverſie, a dull a-la-mode-Reformer, a Tranſlator of Antiquity, that hath pull'd the Church all to pieces, and knows not how to patch it up again; that hath ſhaken the very Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, and then endeavours to bungle it with odde fopperies of his own invention: for the ancient Creed of the Church being quite out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, he has cut out a Confeſſion of faith, according to the large proportion of his own VViſdom; and wyre-drawn the buſineſs above twenty yards in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure beyond the <hi>Alcoran</hi> or <hi>Talmud.</hi> He is one that drives a great Trade in the Trafficks of rich Livings, betwixt
<hi>London</hi> and the Country; and ſo gets a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Revenue to hold up Uſury, and find Candles of Conſolation to cheriſh his Zeal, and leave Portions to the Children of <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is a Stoical Pretender, a Mammoniſt, an Epicure
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46508:20"/>of the Long Robe, and delights infinitely to bathe himſelf in the Golden Streams of Sacriledge. He's a bleating Bell-Weather of the General Aſſembly; and whereſoever there appears any Loyalty, he gives an Alarm to his Lung-pipes immediately; then out comes the Son of the Kirk in array, with all the Bag and Baggage of Uſe and Application, to bring up the Rear of his Sermon. Nay, rather then fail, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and Monarchy ſhall both be brought together to the Stake, and baited by the mad Dogs of the times, to inflame the Multitude.</p>
                  <p>But though they have done this over and over, 'tis all to no purpoſe: for the Bag-pipes draw little or no Company at all now; and are as little regarded as Ballad-ſingers, that are alwayes in one Tune.
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> and <hi>Chevy-Chaſe</hi> are much of the ſame cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and ſtanding. And ſince the people have ſeen Covenant and Concupiſcence (the two Twins of our Mother-Kirk) walk hand in hand together, they are willing now to part them. He's a holy Bellows<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mender of the flea-bitten Synod, that knows how (upon any occaſion) to blow the coals of the Altar, to make a Sacrifice of Cities and Kingdomes. Be confident that he acknowledges no Holy-days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſuperſtition in <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but none in Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and he is not at leaſure to minde the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or
<hi>ſeek thoſe things that are above,</hi> having ſo much to diſpatch about Traffick here below; which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he proſecutes with extreme devotion. But if you ſee him upon a Faſt day, at a Summers Exerciſe, when he baits his Text, and himſelf into a Bathe, you would take him in the Pulpit, for <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his Tub; and if a <hi>Cavalier</hi> chance to preach on Good-Friday,<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46508:20"/>be confident he's clapt in priſon, to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that their Eaſter-Devotions are ſuitable unto their Chriſtmas; and that they care as little for the ſufferings, as the birth of our Saviour. For Zeal (forſooth) that fiery Goſſip will not permit an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Cavaliers, by any means, unleſs they will yeild to have their Conſciences crampt with the Covenant. He's a Divine Puppit that is trimm'd and trick'd up with the fine Phant'ſies of the Directory, and Confeſſion of the New Cut; as alſo all the Whimſies of the Modiſh-Garb of reforming. He's a true <hi>Boanerges</hi> of the Kirk, that can level his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts againſt all ſuch as ſhall preſume to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Civil Governors. Nor are the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in any better condition then the people; for they are affronted by every ranting Presbyter, that raves in the Pulpit, like a Conjurer in his Circle; and dares firſt raiſe the Devil with falſe Doctrine, and then deliver up to him all the Peers of the Realm by an Excommunication: from whence there can be no redemption, but at ſuch a rate, as ſhall coſt them the beſt of their Priviledges, and make them untruſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cloſe-ſtool of Antichriſt, better known by the name of the Stool of Repentance. He is never well but when he is riding both King<note n="*" place="margin">

But if theſe preſent times hold,<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46508:21"/>wherein Loyalty flouriſhes, and Majeſty ſways the Scepter; the blew Sir
<hi>Johns</hi> may return to their ten pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and
<hi>Sunday-pudding:</hi> which is a ſad thing to think on, and will ſooner break the hearts, then the bellies, of the fat Calves of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Mr. <hi>John</hi> is all Zeal, no Knowledge; all Purity, no Humility; all Simplicity, no Honeſty: and if you never truſt him, he will never deceive you. Now as for the Northern Fraternity, whoſe brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal tranſported them heretofore on this ſide <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> to help drive out the Amorite and Hittite, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſend them the bleſſing of <hi>Encreaſe and multiply,</hi> at home; ſuffer Presbytery and Bag-pipes to flouriſh beyond <hi>Berwick;</hi> and keep them (for the future) from making a Mouſe-trap of the Covenant to catch Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen; and ſend them good ſtore of Charity and Succeſs to plant their Diſcipline where more need is among their Brethren, the ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> in the
<hi>High-lands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, take this ſhort Deſcription of our Presbyterian-Jehu, as it was formerly penned by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that in other Ages had experience of him.</p>
                  <p>A Presbyter is an Eſſence that needs a double De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition: for he is not what he appears to be. He's a Church-Rebel, or one that would exclude Order, that his Brain might rule. In things but Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, will ſpurn at the grave authority of the Church; and out of needleſs nicety, be a Thief to himſelf of thoſe Benefits that God hath beſtowed on him. A Thing of ſo croſs-grain'd a temper, that ſhould the<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46508:21"/>Church enjoyn clean Shirrs, he'd wear ſuch as were lowſie. Shew him a Ring, he runs back like a Bear, and hates ſquare-dealing, as being allyed to Caps: A pair of Organs blow him out of the Pariſh, and is the onely Gliſter-pipe to cool him: A Surplice will ſooner cure him of the Chin-cough, then the ſight of a Bear. He is a diſeas'd piece of
<hi>Apocrypha;</hi> bind him to the Bible, and he corrupts the whole Text:
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Fat Feed,</hi> are his Founders; his Nurſe is
<hi>Railing Rabbies,</hi> and <hi>Roman Breeches;</hi> his life is but a borrow'd blaſt of wind: for between two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, as between two Doors, he is ever whiſtling. Truly, whoſe Child he is, is not yet known; for his Faith willingly knows no father. When he makes a Speech, 'tis ſomewhat ominouſly with his Neck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, as if <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Pigeon ſhould come and prompt him in the Ear. He gluts himſelf with Sacrilege, fearing no ſurfeit upon the ſweet Morſels of the Crown and Cathedrals: He faſts once a moneth, and feaſts all the year after, to ſtarve Loyalty quite out of the Kingdom: His tender Conſcience can ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel: The flame of his Zeal ſhin'd ſo brightly, that it once converted all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the <hi>Church</hi> into Tinder, to furniſh his own phanſie with new Lights. He turns the Church into a ſtable, and ſtables into Churches, that our Saviour might be preach'd where he was born.
<hi>Reformation</hi> is his ſtalking-horſe; and though he be no <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> yet he is a <hi>Pariſh-Pope;</hi> one that knows no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Mitre</hi> or <hi>Scepter:</hi> No Jeſuite demands more blind and abſolute obedience from his Vaſſals; no Magiſtrate of the canting ſociety, more ſlaviſh ſubjection from the Members of that travelling ſtate, then the Presbyterian Hypocrite expects from his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46508:22"/>Lay-Pupil. Nay, they muſt not onely be obeyed, fed and defended, but admired; and that their Lay-Proſelytes do as ſincerely, as a ſhirtleſs Fellow with a Cudgel under his arm, does a Face-wringing Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger. 'Tis a demure creature full of Oral ſanctiry, and Mental impiety; a fair Object to the Eye, but ſtark naught to the Underſtanding. He holds it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſteal, ſo it be from the wicked Egyptians. He hates no Wore, like the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> If he meet <hi>per accidens</hi> with a <hi>Tabitha,</hi> he can court her with a <hi>Hail Siſter</hi> to be her Incumbent; and perſwade her 'tis the pr— of Zeal that moves him forward. He's a ſnuffling Rabby known by theſe marks; a long-waſted Conſcience that can out-ſtride a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus, a Gnomon-Noſe, a wrought Cap, a ſwagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pair of ears, and not an inch of hair.</p>

                  <p>He is an unlucky Bird that us'd formerly to croak about VVeſtminſter-Abbey; and if this Daw were not often cramm'd, you were ſure to hear of it in the next Faſt-ſermon: then would he beat up all his Drums in the Pulpit, and thunder againſt the ungodly. He's a pious Thief that did ſo pill the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt, that he lookt as bare as a <hi>Scotch Laird</hi> in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, ſitting on the ſtool of Repentance. He has trimm'd the Cavalier worſe then the angry Barbers of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> uſe to do a Bayliff of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> His fiery Zeal keeps him continually coſtive, which wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers him into his own Tranſlation; and till he eat a ſchool-man, he's hide-bound: Give him advice, you run into Traditions; and urge a modeſt courſe, he<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46508:22"/>cries out, <hi>Councils.</hi> He dares not be honeſt, for that loves order; yet, if he can be brought to ceremony, and made but Maſter of it, he is converted. He's a gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pill compoſed of two vertuous Ingredients, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſhoneſty, and Artificial Diſſimulation. Women and Lawyers are his beſt Diſciples: the one (next fruit) longs for forbidden Doctrine; the other, to maintain forbidden Titles: both which he ſows among them; yet he lives religiouſly according to outward appearance, and will not revel it in a ſhore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs exceſs. He can better afford you ten Lyes, then one Oath; and dare commit any ſin guilded with a pretence of ſanctity. He had rather ſee Antichriſt, then a picture in a Church-Window; and chuſeth ſooner to be half hang'd, then ſee a Leg at the Name of <hi>JESUS,</hi> or an Auditor ſtand at rehearſing of the
<hi>Creed.</hi> He uſually makes moving ſermons; for moſt of the people go out of the <hi>Church</hi> before he has done. His <hi>hums</hi> and
<hi>ha's</hi> with the help of ſalvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the beſt part of the hour; and is of ſo good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that he dare challenge the
<hi>Almighty</hi> to talk with him <hi>Ex tempore.</hi> Beſides, he is ſo ſure of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that he will not change places in heaven with the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> without boot. He has nick-named all the Prophets and Apoſtles with his ſons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets none but Vertues for his daughters. He will be ſure to thwart the Biſhops, though it be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an abſurdity: like the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto <hi>China,</hi> who ſalute by putting off their ſhoes, becauſe the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do it by their hats. 'Tis ſuch a creature as <hi>Pliny</hi> ne'er wrote of; and the like was not to be ſeen in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark. 'Tis a violent Thing made up of <hi>contradiction:</hi> if he faſt on any ſet day, 'tis certainly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46508:23"/>on <hi>Sunday;</hi> but he will be ſure to feaſt on
<hi>Friday.</hi> His opinion has turned his zeal into madneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and out of his blind and uncharitable pride, cenſures and ſcorns others as Reprobates; or out of obſtinacy fills the world with brawlings about undeterminable Tenents: and being once elated with the pride of his Faction, doth ſo contemn all others, that he does infringe the Laws of humane ſociety. He's a ſaint of the new Tranſlation; or if you pleaſe, a ſainted <hi>Salamander,</hi> that lives in the flames of Zeal. A ſtubble-gooſe, that hath fed high in this Harveſt of Reformation: the prime Gandee of the factions flock. An Apocryphal piece of Univerſity-Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery: a holy Pick-lock, that can open mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and pick the purſe of the City with eaſe and dexterity. A Gun-powder Politician, that loves to make Fire-works for the deſtruction of the Loyaliſt. A Divine Squib-crack. The meek man of God, or the hypocrite in grain. An Univerſity-Canker-worm. A grievons Plunderer of the ſaints in Church-windows. A right Phariſaical Jew; one that will compaſs ſea and land to make a Proſelyte. A pious Pulpit-Cuffer. A deadly ſpit-fire. Such a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born lump of ſanctified fleſh, that you may as ſoon perſwade the Scot to forſake his craft, the Jew his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, or the Pope St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Chair, as the Presbyter to leave off his Fanatick Whimſies. In fine, he is ſo much Knave, that 'tis nonſence to call him Fool.</p>
                  <p>I could make it appear, how all ſeditions almoſt and rebellions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have been ſet a foot or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by this Government Presbyterian: how neighborly Feuds have been encreaſed and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: how monies collected for the relief and ſupport
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46508:23"/>of <hi>Geneva,</hi> were by the chief <hi>Gamaliels</hi> and Presbyters interverted, employed to raiſe and pay ſouldiers to aid and aſſiſt the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> and his complices in Rebellion againſt the King. I fear I have wearied you already; the ſubject is everlaſting, and I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould give account of the late practiſes and tenets of this late <hi>Covenant,</hi> it were poſſible to let you ſee that it hath far exceeded all the miſchiefs ever their forefathers did, although they tread in the ſame footſteps.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up all, give me leave, in the cloſe, to give the Articles of their Apoſtatical Creed inconſiſtent with Monarchy, which they hold as the twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Apoſtolical Symbole. I will touch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the prime of thoſe; for their other Articles, they are ſo many, and of ſo vaſt an extent abounding in Negatives, that as King <hi>James</hi> ſaith well, <hi>He that would keep them, is not able to retain them in his brain, but muſt keep them in a Table-book.</hi>
